# Integrating the store-locator into a single-page-application (SPA)

The uberall store-locator works out of the box for server-side-rendered pages, but for single-page-applications there have to be some manual configurations to make the store-locator work. This is often the case for websites which use popular frameworks like React, Vue.js or Angular.

This repo is an example app to showcase how to integrate our store-locator inside a React app.
