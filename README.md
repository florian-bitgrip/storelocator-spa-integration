# Integrating the store-locator into a single-page-application (SPA)

The uberall store-locator works out of the box for server-side-rendered pages, but for single-page-applications there needs to be some manual configuration to make the store-locator work. This is often the case for websites which use popular frameworks like React, Vue.js or Angular.

This repo is an example app to showcase how to integrate our store-locator inside a React app.

## How to start the app

- add your storefinder-key to the [store-locator component](https://github.com/uberall/storelocator-spa-integration/blob/main/src/routes/RouteWithStoreLocator.js)

- In the project directory, to install the packages, run `npm install`

- In the project directory, to start the example app, run: `npm start`

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
